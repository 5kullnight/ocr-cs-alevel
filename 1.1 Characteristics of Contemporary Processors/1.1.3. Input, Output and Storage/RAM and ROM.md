#### **RAM (Random Access Memory)**
- **Purpose**: Temporary storage for data and programs currently in use by the computer.
- **Key Characteristics**:
    - **Fast**: Faster than secondary storage.
    - **Volatile**: Loses data when power is turned off.
    - **Capacity**: Typically 4GB–8GB in most systems, much smaller than secondary storage.
    - **Usage**: Enhances speed and performance during program execution.

#### **ROM (Read-Only Memory)**
- **Purpose**: Stores permanent, unchangeable instructions, such as the computer’s start-up (bootstrap) routine.
- **Key Characteristics**:
    - **Non-Volatile**: Retains data even when powered off.
    - **Unmodifiable**: Contents are programmed once and cannot be altered.
    - **Usage**: Essential for fixed, critical instructions needed for system boot-up.
