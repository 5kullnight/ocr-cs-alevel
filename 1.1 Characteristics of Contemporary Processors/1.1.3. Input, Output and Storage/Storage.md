#### **1. Optical Storage**
- **Examples**: CDs, DVDs, Blu-Ray.
- **Mechanism**: Data stored as pits (0) and lands (1), read using laser light.
- **Key Points**:
    - **CD**: Small capacity (up to 700MB), portable, used for audio and images.
    - **DVD**: Higher capacity (4.7GB-17GB), suited for videos.
    - **Blu-Ray**: Very high capacity (up to 128GB), ideal for HD content.
- **Disadvantages**: Prone to scratches, slower transfer speeds, limited storage.

#### **2. Magnetic Storage**
- **Examples**: HDDs, Magnetic Tape, Floppy Disks.
- **Mechanism**: Binary data stored as polarised (1) or unpolarised (0) magnetic regions.
- **HDDs**:
    - Large capacity (500GB to 5TB).
    - **Advantages**: Affordable, high storage.
    - **Disadvantages**: Slower speeds, fragile due to moving parts.
- **Magnetic Tape**:
    - Used historically for data storage; now outdated.
    - Bulky, slow access.
- **Floppy Disks**:
    - Portable but low capacity (1MB). Outdated for modern needs.

#### **3. Flash Storage**
- **Examples**: SSDs, USB Drives, Memory Cards.
- **Mechanism**: Binary data stored using NAND/NOR gates, representing high (1) and low (0) electrical states.
- **SSDs**:
    - **Advantages**: Fast, portable, durable (no moving parts), and non-volatile.
    - **Disadvantages**: Expensive per GB, limited lifespan due to wear from repeated writes.
