- Performs **arithmetic operations**: e.g., addition, subtraction (on fixed/floating point numbers).
- Performs **logical operations**: Boolean logic like AND, OR, NOT, XOR.
### **Example: Addition Instruction**
1. **Operation**: Add two numbers.
2. **Input**: Two binary numbers.
    - Example: `5` (binary: `0101`) and `3` (binary: `0011`).
3. **ALU Action**: Perform binary addition.
    - `0101 + 0011 = 1000` (binary), which equals `8` in decimal.
4. **Output**: The result of the addition (`1000`).
