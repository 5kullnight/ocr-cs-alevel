1. **Clock Speed**
    - **Definition**: Clock speed refers to how fast the CPU can process instructions. It is determined by the **system clock**, which switches between 0 and 1 to generate pulses. Each CPU operation starts on a clock pulse.
    - **Unit**: Measured in **Hertz (Hz)**, typically GHz (billions of cycles per second).
    - **Impact**:
        - A higher clock speed means faster processing of instructions.
        - Example: A CPU with a clock speed of **3.2 GHz** completes **3.2 billion cycles per second**.
        - Limitation: Higher speeds can cause overheating, requiring better cooling.

2. **Number of Cores**
    - **Definition**: A core is an independent processing unit within the CPU. Each core can execute its own **fetch-decode-execute cycle** simultaneously.
    - **Impact**:
        - More cores mean the CPU can handle multiple instructions at the same time.
        - Example:
            - A **dual-core** processor can handle **2 tasks** simultaneously.
            - A **quad-core** processor can handle **4 tasks**.
    - **Limitation**: Performance gains depend on software optimization. Some programs are not designed to use multiple cores efficiently.
	    - For example, a **Minecraft server** can run on multiple cores, but its performance may not fully utilize them. Many Minecraft server operations are single-threaded, meaning that only one core handles certain tasks, like world generation or player interactions. While some tasks can be distributed across multiple cores (like handling multiple players), the core gameplay mechanics and world updates can bottleneck performance, resulting in limited gains from additional cores. This illustrates how software design impacts the ability to leverage multicore architectures effectively.

3. **Cache Memory**
    - **Definition**: Cache memory is a small amount of high-speed memory located inside the CPU. It stores frequently used instructions to improve processing speed.
    - **Impact**:
        - Reduces the time needed to access data from main memory (RAM).
        - Larger or faster cache allows quicker data access.
    - Example: When you use a web browser, it often stores copies of web pages, images, and other resources in a **cache** to improve loading times for frequently visited sites. 
		**How It Works**:
		1. **First Visit**: When you visit a website for the first time, your browser downloads all the necessary files (HTML, CSS, images) from the server and saves them in its cache.
		2. **Subsequent Visits**: On your next visit to the same website, the browser first checks its cache to see if it already has the files needed to display the page. If the files are in the cache, it loads them quickly from local storage instead of downloading them again from the server, resulting in faster loading times.
    - **Types of Cache**:
        - **Level 1 (L1)**:
            - **Description**: This is the smallest and fastest type of cache, located directly on the CPU chip. It typically has a capacity of 32KB to 128KB and operates at the speed of the CPU clock.
			- **Example**: Think of L1 cache as a personal assistant who keeps the most frequently used notes and reminders right next to you. For instance, when a CPU core is processing data, it uses the L1 cache to store the most commonly accessed data (like the last few calculations or variables) for immediate access, ensuring ultra-fast retrieval.
        - **Level 2 (L2)**:
            - **Description**: This cache is larger than L1 (usually 256KB to several megabytes) but slower. It acts as a secondary storage layer that provides additional data to the CPU when L1 cache misses occur.
			- **Example**: Think of the L2 cache as a **desk drawer** where you keep important documents that you don’t need all the time but still want to access quickly without searching through a other cabinets. When the personal assistant (L1 cache) can’t find what you need, you can quickly open the drawer (L2 cache) to look for the information instead of going to the other cabinets (main memory), which takes longer.
        - **Level 3 (L3)**:
            - **Description**: L3 cache is even larger (ranging from several megabytes to tens of megabytes) and slower than L1 and L2. It is often shared among multiple CPU cores.
			- **Example**: Think of L3 cache as a large library shared among several assistants. If the personal assistant and the filing cabinet don’t have the needed information, they can send a request to the library (L3 cache). While it's slower than getting the information from the personal assistant or filing cabinet, it’s still quicker than retrieving it from an external source (RAM).
